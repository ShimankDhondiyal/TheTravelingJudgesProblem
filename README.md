# The Travelling Judges Problem

A group of judges must get together to judge a contest held in a particular city, and they need to figure out the cheapest way of renting cars in order to get everyone to the contest. They observed that it might be cheaper if several judges share a rental car during all or part of the trip, thus reducing the overall cost. Your task is to identify the routes the judges should take in order to minimize the total cost of their car rentals.

We will make the following assumptions:

- The cost of a rental car is proportional to the distance it is driven. There are no charges for more than one occupant in the car, fuel, insurance, or leaving the car in a city other than that in which it was rented.

- All rental cars are billed at the same rate per mile.

- A rental car can accommodate any number of passengers.

- At most one road directly connects any pair of cities. Each road is two-way and has an integer length greater than zero.

- There is at least one route from every judgeâ€™s starting city to the city in which the contest is held.

- All judges whose routes to the contest take them from or through the same city travel from that city to the contest together. (A judge might arrive at a city in one car and leave that city in a different car.)
